Clicks in Spanish, English, and many other languages, are sounds that people make, usually without realizing it. In previous research, we consider clicks to be discourse markers or fillers, similar to ‘uh’ or ‘uhm’. We also analyzed the different functions that these clicks have. For example, one of the most frequent functions is for a search, when a speaker clicks before searching for what to say next.

 

Clicks are interesting for different reasons, and have not been studied from a linguistic perspective until relatively recently. In our present study, we selected a data corpus of interviews with bilingual speakers in Texas. From the corpus, we randomly selected 36 speakers and took into consideration age, gender, place of birth (U.S or Mexico), level and use of Spanish, and education.

 

Based on previous research, the use of clicks appears to be idiosyncratic in the sense that not all speakers click, and those who do click produce these sounds with varying frequency. For this reason, we would assume that variables such as gender, age, place of birth, etc., are not factors that condition click usage. This assumption informs the following hypotheses:

 

Hypothesis #1: There will not be a statistically significant difference in the ratio of words per click based on the following variables: gender, age, place of birth, domain, speaking ability, and education.

 

Hypothesis #2: There will not be a statistically significant difference in the functions of clicks based on the following variables: gender, age, place of birth, domain, speaking ability, and education.

 

Hypothesis #3: There will not be a statistically significant difference in the placement of clicks based on the following variables: gender, age, place of birth, domain, speaking ability, and education.
